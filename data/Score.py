"""WattBot Score — the metric for the WattBot 2026 leaderboard.

A weighted accuracy in [0, 1], averaged over questions, of four fields per answer:

    answer_value   0.75   numeric within +-0.1%, categorical exact after normalization,
                          'is_blank' when the corpus cannot answer the question
    ref_id         0.20   citation F1 against the gold citation set
    is_NA          0.05   a refusal must blank every evidence field, not just the value
    answer_unit    0.00   given in test_Q.csv, so reported but not scored

Answering a question the corpus cannot support scores zero on answer_value AND on is_NA:
guessing is strictly worse than abstaining. Full rules are in score()'s docstring, which
is what Kaggle shows participants on the Evaluation tab.

The per-evidence-type breakdown reads the Quote/Table/Figure/Math/is_NA/CrossPaper/
Reconcile columns straight off the solution frame. If the uploaded solution ever loses
them, the headline score keeps working and the breakdown silently goes empty.

Sanity check after any change: ground truth scored against itself must print exactly 1.000.

# Switched to F1 because making citation sets exhaustive made Jaccard punitive: gold sets

    WattBot Score (0–1)

    Submissions are scored with a custom WattBot Score that evaluates four fields
    for every question and returns a weighted accuracy:

    Component      Weight  What counts as correct
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    answer_value    0.75   Matches the ground truth. Numeric answers must be within
                           ±0.1% relative tolerance (and ~1e-3 absolute fallback);
                           categorical values must match exactly after normalization.
                           If a question is unanswerable, this column must contain
                           'is_blank'.

    answer_unit     0.00   Reported but not scored: the expected unit is given to you in
                           test_Q.csv, so scoring it would be free marks. It is given
                           because 30% of questions do not state their unit in the question
                           text, and withholding it would make the ANSWER ambiguous.

    ref_id          0.20   **Partial credit via citation F1** between your ref_id set and
                           the ground-truth set (order ignored, case-insensitive). Gold
                           citation sets are exhaustive, so recall alone would punish a
                           team for citing one correct source instead of all four;
                           precision alone would not punish citing everything. Use
                           'is_blank' if no evidence is available.

    is_NA (NA)      0.05   For truly unanswerable questions your submission must mark
                           answer_value, ref_id, ref_url and supporting_materials as
                           'is_blank'. Refusing in answer_value while still supplying a
                           citation or a quote — a hedged bluff — scores 0 here.
                           (answer_unit may carry the expected unit.) The penalty for
                           answering outright lives in answer_value, above.

    CHANGED FOR 2026 — abstention is scored. Some questions cannot be answered from the
    corpus. Through 2025 the answer_value component was credited unconditionally on those
    questions ("nothing expected"), so inventing an answer forfeited only the 0.10 NA
    component. Answering an unanswerable question now scores ZERO on answer_value as well.
    If the evidence is not in the corpus, put 'is_blank' in answer_value: guessing is
    strictly worse than abstaining.

    Notes:
    - Output: returns the final score as a float in [0, 1]. It also prints per-component
      accuracies, citation precision/recall/F1, the false-answer rate on unanswerable
      questions, and a % wrong breakdown by evidence type (Quote/Table/Figure/Math/is_NA).
      Those diagnostics are printed only — Kaggle's metric contract requires a single
      float return, so they cannot become leaderboard columns. Participants can reproduce
      the breakdown by running this file locally against train_QA.csv.
